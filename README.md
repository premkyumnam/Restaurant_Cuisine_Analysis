In this project, I analyzed a restaurant dataset to identify food trends. The goal of the first task was to:

Identify the top three most common cuisines in the dataset.
Calculate the percentage of restaurants serving each of these cuisines.
Tools & Technologies:
To achieve this, I used the following tools and technologies:

Pandas: For data analysis, cleaning, exploration, and manipulation.
NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.
Matplotlib: For data visualization, including plots, charts, and graphs.
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization, building on Matplotlib.
Counter (Collections): For counting hashable objects, such as frequency analysis.
Jupyter Notebook: As the primary environment for data processing and analysis.
These tools enabled me to effectively extract insights and meaning from the data.

Results:
I identified the top three most common cuisines and calculated the percentage of restaurants serving each:

North Indian: 3,960 restaurants (41.50%)
Chinese: 2,735 restaurants (28.66%)
Fast Food: 1,986 restaurants (20.81%)
A huge thanks to Cognifyz Technologies for this amazing learning opportunity! Every step in this journey is helping me grow, and I'm excited for what's next.
