In this project, I'll analyze a restaurant dataset to identify food trends. 
The goal of this first task is to- 
1. Identify the top three most common cuisines in the dataset and
2. Calculate the percentage of restaurants serving each of these cuisines.

Tools & Technologies:

To achieve this, I used the following Tools & Technologies:

1. Pandas: For data analysis, cleaning, exploration, and manipulation.
2. NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.
3. Matplotlib: For data visualization, including plots, charts, and graphs.
4. Seaborn: For statistical data visualization, building on Matplotlib.
5. Counter (Collections): For counting hashable objects, such as frequency analysis.
6. Jupyter Notebook: As the primary environment for data processing and analysis.

These tools would enable me to effectively extract insights and meaning from the data.

Results:

I identified the top three most common cuisines and calculated the percentage of restaurants serving each:
1. North Indian: 3,960 restaurants (41.5%)
2. Chinese: 2,735 restaurants (28.66%)
3. Fast Food: 1,986 restaurants (20.81%)

   A huge thanks to Cognifyz Technologies for this amazing learning opportunity!
   Every step in this journey is helping me grow, and I'm excited for what's next.
